One of my projects to learn a bit about the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/) and the [Google maps directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro).

The overall aim is to query the API in a configurable frequence for different journeys to derive a histogram of travel time for different times of a day or comparable.
